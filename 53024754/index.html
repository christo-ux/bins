  <h1>Farata recipe</h1>
  <p>Farata is the Mauritian version of Indian paratha, a layered, 
    flaky, pan-fried flatbread. It consists of three basic ingredients: flour, water, and oil.
    Faratas are traditionally served warm,
    accompanying spicy curry dishes or any kind of chutney. The farata itself taste so good, so
    when you add spicy curry such as fish or chicken curry, accompanied with turban squash 
    which melts in the mouth, its like an explosion of flavour with a mixture of texture.

    <li>In a mixing bowl, rub melted butter into flour until it resembles breadcrumbs.
      Gradually add the warm water to make soft dough.
      Cover the dough mixture with a cloth and set aside for at least
      <em> 15 minutes</em> to rest.<id="emoji">⏳
